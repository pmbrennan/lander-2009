"Special Delivery","Something which was never attempted with Apollo.  The goal is to attempt a direct landing on the moon's surface without using an intermediate parking orbit.  This would be appropriate if the LM was sent from Earth directly as an unmanned cargo vehicle, for example.  You will begin on hyperbolic approach to the moon, with the perilune set at 10km.  Prepare for a wild ride, because the base is in the highlands, and there are some mountains between your perilune and your target!",90,0,0,0,1,117.23,21698,1,-805049.35035,1564071.86636,205.80000,2174.73851,930.64695,0.00000,"LM",6531,8165,8165,14.56,3050,3.45
